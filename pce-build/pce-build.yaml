# Ansible playbook that build SNC, MNC or Multu-region PCE inside AWS.....
#
# site.yml is the primary playbook that will call other roles: aws, common, and snc/mnc/multi-region.  
# using the ec2 modules that reqiuire the boto python module to work.
# 
# Because the hosts have not been built the site.yml doesnt not require a host file.  It calls the local machine running the playbook.
# 
# This playbook only creates the AWS instances.  There is a aws-delete.yml that will scan AWS for any of the created environments and delete them.  
# This requires the ec2.py python script.  Go here to download the script: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/devel/contrib/inventory/ec2.py  
# In addition the ec2.ini is required: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/devel/contrib/inventory/ec2.ini.  
#

# After boto is installed there should be in your home directory .aws/  The directory should contain credentials and config.  ~/.aws/config and ~/.aws/credentials
#  The format should be as follows:
#
#
# [default]
# aws_access_key_id = <AWS USER KEY>
# aws_secret_access_key = <AWS USER KEY SECRET>

# Inside the ~/.aws/config you should place the region you want to be used by the ec2.py as the default AWS region
# [default]
# region=us-east-2
# output=json
